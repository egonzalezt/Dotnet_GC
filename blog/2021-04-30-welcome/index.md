Welcome to dotnet GC, I decided to create this website to document all the interesting things that I learn on .NET Garbage Collector that helps me to profile and improve the performance of different applications.

This website is made with Docusaurus to help me to document using markdown easily and simply. any help will be appreciated and I will not hesitate to review the changes you generate in the PR to improve or make changes, you can visit my GitHub where you can find the code of this application.
